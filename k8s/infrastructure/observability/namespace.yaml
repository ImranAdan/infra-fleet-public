# Observability Namespace
# Managed by Flux (not Terraform) to avoid state conflicts
#
# Why Flux manages this:
# - Flux creates HelmReleases in this namespace
# - Resources may have finalizers (though not in Phase 1 - no Ingress)
# - Flux can cleanly delete namespace when we remove this file
# - No Terraform state conflicts during destroy
